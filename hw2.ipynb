This is because functions like `np.divide` will change their output type in order to present a more accurate answer. However, this may result in type conflicts in our current version of needle. Forcibly casting like this is not the optimal solution, and we will probably revisit it later, but it is an acceptable workaround for now."

Furthermore, we typically batch our data. Therefore, we will also construct a `BatchSampler`, which will take a `Sampler` and return the sampled indexes as batches instead of individual indexes.
